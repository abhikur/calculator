# Calculator

This is a simple calculator which could be used to do basic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

## How to run
I am using gradle as the build tool, so clone this repo and sync the gradle dependencies. There is only one dependency for this calculator which is JUnit for testing purpose

There is no main method, so to check the result there are tests that you can run.

## How to run tests
Go to the command line and do
`./gradlew test`
